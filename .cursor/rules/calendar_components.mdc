## CalendarWidget Implementation
- Uses React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo)
- Tab-based navigation between month and week views
- Google Calendar authorization with connect/refresh capabilities
- Efficient event fetching with date range optimization
- Proper handling of all-day events with timezone considerations
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Event grouping and sorting by type (all-day and timed events)
- Optimized rendering to prevent redundant API calls
