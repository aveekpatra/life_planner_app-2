# Application Data Flow

## Data Flow Patterns
- React components use the `useQuery` hook from Convex to fetch data
- Data mutations use the `useMutation` hook
- Google Calendar integration uses both Convex for auth and direct API calls

## Entity Structure
- Tasks: To-do items with status, priority and projects
- Events: Calendar events with start/end times
- Notes: Text notes for quick capture
- Projects: Organizational units for tasks and notes
- Bookmarks: Saved links and references

## State Management
- Database state is managed through Convex
- UI state is managed with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- External services like Google Calendar have dedicated hooks and services
